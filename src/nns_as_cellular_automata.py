#TODO: model neural network as 1D CA
#TODO: replicate a chaotic rule / chaotic behaviour
#TODO: plot deep nn as 1dca over time, then each iteration of the weights changing as a new 1dca over time
#TODO: compare nn with activation functions that cause periodic or chaotic behaviour - does it allow better learning (i.e. learns to control chaos by changing weights and thus neighbours)
#TODO: new learning paradigm? modifying activation functions rather than weights? (i.e keep all weights 1, but modify the complexity / rules of activation function)
